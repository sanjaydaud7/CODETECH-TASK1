Integrate with the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data for a given city.
Develop a JavaScript function to handle the search button click event and fetch the weather data from the API.
Update the user interface with the fetched weather data, including the city name, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather icon.
Handle errors and display an error message if the city is not found or if there is an issue with the API request.
Technologies Used:

HTML5: Used for structuring the content of the web page.
CSS3: Used for styling and layout of the web page.
JavaScript: Used for handling the search button click event, fetching weather data from the API, and updating the user interface.
OpenWeatherMap API: Used for fetching weather data for a given city.
